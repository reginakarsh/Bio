<p>What can I tell you that won't sound like a typical bio? I didn't grow up with a dad. I enjoyed playing with bugs more than hanging out with my mom. I wanted to be an attorney when I grew up until I learned what attorneys do all day. In college, I was the President of the Honor's Society. I took way too many classes just because I could. Now I have quite a bit of student loan debt AND I can discuss philosophy until I'm blue, in Russian. I didn't have a boy child. I'm quite fond of being a mom, though for a bit, I wasn't sure how that was going to go. Married life is nice. I like getting back rubs. Someday, I'd like to build an app that helps with my relationship coaching career. I guess I need to get that career started, once I'm out of coding camp.</p>
